# Face-Detection-Using-OpenCV-and-Python
 
Learning to implement OpenCV and Python for Face detection and identification. To get started with, it's a basic facial recognition and identification program, built using Haar cascade classifier which is an OpenCV library. To obtain more accuracy and precision we need to implement Deep Learning model using keras and tensorflow.
